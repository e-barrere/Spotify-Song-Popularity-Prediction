Data Camp | M2 Data Sciences 2021-2022

In this challenge, our objective is to be able to predict the popularity of song based on its audio features.  
The notebook containing the description of the data and the challenge is available [here](https://github.com/e-barrere/Spotify-Song-Popularity-Prediction/blob/master/spotify_popularity_starting_kit.ipynb).

## Installation 
 - install `ramp-workflow` library 
 - run `$ pip install git+https://github.com/esarf/datacamp-loyers.git`
 
## Testing the predictions locally  

 Once in the good folder, run :  
  `ramp-test --submission = starting_kit`
  
 Or for a quicker test, run :  
 `ramp-test --submission = starting_kit --quick-test `

Eventually, the notebook might not display correctly due to its size and the interactive plots we put in it. Then to see it properly, you can either run it locally, or follow these steps :  
- go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org  
- copy paste the link you have to the `starting-kit.ipynb` on the webpage  
- enjoy!
